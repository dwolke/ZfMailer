**WARNING:** This module is currently under  heavy development and is not intended for use in productive environment.

## Introduction

ZfMailer is a simple e-mail module for Zend Framework based on *Zend\Mail*. E-mails can be sent in text format or as MIME-compliant "multi-part" mails. Sending e-mails with attachments is also supported.

Currently, only sending e-mails by SMTP is supported. Maybe this module will be extended later with further possibilities.

## Installation

### Main Setup

1. Add this project and the requirements in your composer.json:

```json
"require": {
  "dwolke/zf-mailer": "dev-master"
}
```

2. Now tell composer to download ZfMailer by running the command:

```bash
$ php composer.phar update
```

### Post Installation

After installation with composer, add the module to your application.config.php.

```php
<?php

return array(
  'modules' => array(
    // ...
    'ZfMailer',
    // ...
  ),
  // ...
);
```



## Settings

Copy the configuration file from `vendor/dwolke/zf-mailer/config/zfmailer.local.php.dist` to `config/autoload/zfmailer.local.php` and change the values as desired.

* **return_path** [string, optional] - Address to which bounces are sent
* **reply_to** [string, optional] - Address to which replys are sent.
* **x_mailer** [string, optinal] - Adds the 'X-Mailer' header to an e-mail

## Usage

Using the mailer is quite simple.

```php

// get the service
$mailer = $serviceManager->get('ZfMailer\Service\Mailer');

// create a new mail
$mailer->createNewMail($recipient, $subject, $sender);

// set the content and render the e-mail body
$mailer->prepareAsMultipart($mailContent, $textTemplate, $htmlTemplate);

// send the e-mail
$mailer->sendEmail();
```
That's all.
